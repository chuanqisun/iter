# Iter

A minimalist fontend for Azure OpenAI Chat models, optimized for rapid prompt iteration.

- **Privacy first**  
  Credentials stored in your browser. All requests directly sent to API without no middleman server
- **Fork-able history**  
  So you can explore different variantions of the prompt that share the same history
- **Parallel chat**  
  Streaming chat response from multiple submissions at the same time
- **API endpoint and model hot-swap**  
  Switch between different APIs and models without losing any chat progress

\*This project is still an early experiment. Please share product feedback vis GitHub Issues page. Thank you!
