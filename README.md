- **ðŸ¦‰ Adapts to OS/Browser default theme**: Dark theme for happy night owls
- **ðŸ’… Markdown parser**: Built-in syntax highlight and copy button for code blocks
- **ðŸ§­ Artifacts**: Run code blocks for SVG, HTML, Mermaid, TypeScript, and React in JSX
- **ðŸ’» Interpreter**: Process uploaded files with TypeScript and any browser-friendly npm packages
